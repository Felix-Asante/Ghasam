              AMCI grant is seven hundred and fifty Dirhams <b>(750 MAD)</b> per month and is granted for the regulatory duration of the cycle followed, and paid bimonthly <b>(1500 MAD for two months)</b> in accordance with the schedule set by AMCI. However, a student receives 1250 MAD in the months of March, May and June because AMCI spends 750 MAD of every student’s annual grant on the AXA Health Insurance.<br><br> <i>Payment of the grants is made at the counters of branches of the <b>Banque Populaire</b> across the Kingdom on presentation of the beneficiary's passport</i>. To this end, the student is required to check the validity of his passport, and proceed to its renewal when it expires and immediately submit a copy to AMCI.<br><br> The scholarship is renewed, as the case may be, either at the beginning of each academic year, or at the beginning of the academic semester for students in the semester system. <br><br>

              The following documents are required for the registration or renewal of the scholarship:

            With French being the lingua franca in Moroccan higher educational institutions, it is imperative to take a six-month preparatory course in basic French during your first year in Morocco as a new and non-French-speaking student.<br> <br>
            The International Centre for Languages (Centre International des langues, CIL) is a structure directly subordinate to AMCI, created in 2011 in response to strong regular demand from non-French-speaking partner countries, who wish to offer their students in Morocco, the possibility of an upgrade in the French language.<br><br>
            Since the creation of CIL, hundreds of non-French-speaking students have thus benefited from a language course supervised and taught in the best conditions by qualified teachers and according to a specialized educational program.<br><br>
            These sessions usually take place from January to June, during which students are usually accommodated at the International Students Hostel (Cité Universitaire International, CUI). At the end of the year, students who successfully complete the course receive a certificate of approval with qualification for the pursuit of higher education in Morocco.<br><br>
            Installed in a green and conducive environment to pleasant learning, CIL offers specific and thematic courses in Moroccan dialect (Darija) for all students, with the aim of offering them daily communication tools geared towards facilitating their adaptation and familiarization with their new environment.

        <h2>ACCOMMODATION AT THE CITÉ UNIVERSITAIRE INTERNATIONALE (CUI)</h2>
        <p id="r2">
          AMCI has an International University Hostel (CUI) in Rabat, open to foreign students and interns, selected by AMCI.<br><br>
         
         Each year, the Cité Universitaire Internationale de Rabat welcomes students of different nationalities as part of the framework of cooperation agreements between Morocco and partner countries. With more than 70 nationalities and as many cultures rubbing shoulders there every day, CUI is undoubtedly the most cosmopolitan place in Morocco.<br><br>
         Accommodation at CUI is valid for one (1) academic year. The residence expires latest by July 30 of the current year, the month of August being reserved for room maintenance and renovations.<br><br>

         Applications for accommodation at the CUI must be submitted to AMCI within the allotted time and must include the following documents:
         <br>
       <ul class="li r4" style="font-style: italic;margin-left: 10px; list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>CUI accommodation request form (Formulaire de demande d'hébergement), to be taken from the hostel administration or <b><a style="color: red" href="#">download from here</a></b> , duly completed</li>
          <li class="r4">Commitment form (Formulaire d'engagement) to comply with the hostel regulations, duly completed by the applicant;</li>
           <li>Certified photocopy of School enrolment certificate (Attestation d’Inscription), for the year concerned, indicating the level of studies;</li>

           </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
        Residents at the hostel must pay accommodation fees, amounts of which are set as follows:<br><br>
        1. 50 MAD / month, for students of different Education cycles;<br>
        2. 200 to 500 MAD / month, for candidates carrying out research or internships.<br><br>
        In addition, the resident is also required to pay a fixed deposit of 200 DH, which will be used to cover unpaid fees and the amounts of damage and degradation observed on departure. In the event that the deposit turns out to be insufficient, the resident will be required to pay the supplement.<br><br>
        For students receiving the AMCI scholarship, the amounts of the deposit and accommodation are taken directly from their scholarship by the relevant AMCI department.<br><br>
        For students, trainees and researchers who do not receive AMCI scholarships, for the year concerned, payment is made in full, at the time of registration, to the AMCI management.

          However, students wishing to benefit from accommodation in a university residence must send the required file to AMCI through diplomatic channels and within the allotted time.<br><br>
          Students’ files must be submitted to the Accommodation Service at Cité Universitaire International (C.U.I) (Office n ° 5), usually between July and October, and must include the following documents:<br>
